This is a Machine Learning Project for Breast Cancer Prediction.

Background: Breast cancer is now the most likely reason a woman will die from cancer. Finding breast masses or other changes in a breast might cause worry about breast cancer. That's understandable. But breast masses are common. Most often they're noncancerous (benign), particularly in younger women.  So early diagnosis is the most important thing in its treatment.
We want to enhance the prediction of Breast cancer from the data by applying Machine Learning Algorithms to get the best prediction with the Application Result.

Data Set: 32 features, 569 samples

Feature Selection: PCA & Kernel PCA.
